## Crypthon - A File Encryption Tool

Crypthon is a Python project designed to offer a straightforward yet secure solution for file encryption and decryption. Leveraging AES-GCM for encryption and combining SHA-256 with PBKDF2HMAC for secure password management, Crypthon aims to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
Features

    - File encryption and decryption using AES-GCM.
    - Secure generation of encryption keys from a user-provided password.
    - Command line interface for easy use.
